# Multi-Class Neural Network (from scratch) 🧠🔢

This project implements a customizable **multi-class neural network** using only NumPy. It allows interactive architecture definition and supports datasets with more than two classes.

### ✨ Highlights:
- Pure NumPy, no deep learning libraries
- Multi-class support (one-hot encoded labels)
- Customizable number of layers and neurons
- ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions
- Uses cross-entropy loss

### 📊 Example Dataset:
Trained on the **Iris dataset** with one-hot encoded targets and scaled features.

### ⚙️ How to Use:
When prompted, enter the number of layers and number of neurons per layer. For the final layer, use a number equal to the number of classes.

### 📦 Requirements:
```bash
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
